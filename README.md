# dashcat

You probably don't want or need this. 

This is a plugin designed to help me learn about the process of creating a WordPress plugin and to get some basic PHP under my belt. 

The basic premise of this plugin is to pull from a predetermined array of some 12-20 (mostly) cat photos and display one randomly. It should also give the option of emailing the plugin author and/ or emailing the picture presented to a friend.
